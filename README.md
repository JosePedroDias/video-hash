# search image in videos

using a basic perceptual hash algorithm,  
trying to find a frame from a pool of videos

1. video server must support ranged requests
2. video server should support CORS, otherwise one has to download the file or use a proxy so the parsing step is possible

* once the video parsing ends, copy the console.log line into `results/all.js`
* the save screenshot button saves frame so you can look for it in the search page O:)
